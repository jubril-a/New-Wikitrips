                <p class="paragraph">Pay the non-refundable visa application fee, which you are required to pay it before your interview.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Gather Required Documentation</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Gather and prepare the following required documents before your visa interview:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><span class="term">Passport: </span>Valid for travel to the United States, your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your period of stay in the United States.</li>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The purpose of your trip,</li>
                    <li>Your intent to depart the United States after your trip, and/or</li>
                    <li>Your ability to pay all costs of the trip. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraph">Evidence of your employment and/or your family ties may be sufficient to show the purpose of your trip and your intent to return to your home country. If you cannot cover all the costs for your trip, you may show evidence that another person will cover some or all costs for your trip.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Note: Visa applicants must qualify based on their ties abroad/to their home country, rather than assurances from U.S. family and friends. A letter of invitation or Affidavit of Support is not needed to apply for a visitor visa. If you choose to bring a letter of invitation or Affidavit of Support to your interview, please remember it is not one of the factors used in determining whether to issue or deny the visa.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Attend Your Visa Interview</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">A consular officer will interview you to determine whether you are qualified to receive a visitor visa. You must establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive a visa. Ink-free, digital fingerprint scans are taken as part of the application process. They are usually taken during your interview.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">After your visa interview, the consular officer may determine that your application requires further administrative processing. The consular officer will inform you if this required after the visa is approved, and make arrangements for the return of your passport and visa to you.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Entering the United States</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">A visa allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States. If you are allowed to enter the United States, the CBP official will provide an admission stamp or a paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Extending Your Stay</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Failure to depart the United States on time will result in being out of status. Under U.S. law, visas of individuals who are out of status are automatically voided. Any multiple entry visa that was voided due to being out of status will not be valid for future entries into the United States. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Failure to depart the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas in the future.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Change of Status</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">If your plans change while in the United States (for example, you marry a U.S. citizen or receive an offer of employment), you may be able to request a change in your nonimmigrant status to another category through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
                <p class="paragraph">While you are in the United States, receiving a change of status from USCIS does not require you to apply for a new visa. However, once you depart the United States you must apply for a new visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the appropriate category for your travel.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Additional Information</h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>An individual on a visitor visa (B1/B2) is not permitted to accept employment or work in the United States.</li>
                    <li>There is no guarantee you will be issued a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.</li>
                    <li>A valid U.S. visa in an expired passport is still valid. Unless canceled or revoked, a visa is valid until its expiration date. If you have a valid visa in your expired passport, do not remove it from your expired passport. You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States. </li>
