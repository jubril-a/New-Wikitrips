                        <h3>American Visa</h3>
                        <p>The United States can not be defined solely by television and movies. It is large, complex, and diverse,
                            with several distinct regional identities. Due to the vast distances involved, traveling between regions
                            often means crossing through many different landscapes, climates, and even time zones. Such travel can
                            often be time-consuming and expensive but is often very rewarding. Home to the worldâ€™s third-largest
                            population, with over 318 million people, it includes both densely populated cities with sprawling
                            suburbs and vast, uninhabited natural areas.</p>

                        <h3>Canadian Visa</h3>
                        <p>Canada is a land of vast distances and rich natural beauty. Economically and technologically,
                            and in many other ways she closely resembles her neighbour to the south, the United States,
                            although there are significant differences between the two countries.  Canada is perfectly happy
                            with its British heritage and many Canadians are proud of this. Much of Canada's current built
                            environment and influence has come primarily from immigrants from two European nations, Britain and France.</p>

                        <p>The UK has many cities. England is home to London, the biggest city in the UK and also its capital city.
                            There are also many other big cities in England including Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Bristol
                            and Newcastle upon Tyne. Scotland has the big cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Cardiff and Swansea are in
                            Wales and Belfast is in Northern Ireland. The UK had a dominating empire named the British Empire</p>
